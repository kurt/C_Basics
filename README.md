# C_Basics

Just some code to track some basics of the C language for personal reference. Topics include

- Header Files
- Global Variables
- Static Variables
- "sizeof" variables
- Malloc()
- Pointers returned from functions



To Do:

- Figure out the size of functions (stack size) - this is done through linker/compiler options
- Pointers
- Free()
