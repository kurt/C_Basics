# C_Basics

Just some code to track some basics of the C language for personal reference.



 **Topics include**

- Header Files
- Global Variables
- Static Variables
- "sizeof" variables, pointers and structures
- Dynamic Memory - Malloc() and Free() 
- Pointers
  -  returned from functions
  - dereferencing
  - generic pointers (void *ptr)
  - passing data into/out of functions
  - passing functions with pointers (functional programming)
  - passing arrays into functions - this is done using pointers
- Arrays
  - passed to functions



**To Do:**

- ~~Figure out the size of functions (stack size) - this is done through linker/compiler options~~
- Pointers: passing stings and arrays to functions
- type casting
  - pointers: addr= (structure_name *)function(function_input); 

## How To Run

**Compiled using GCC on Windows 10**

"gcc Header_Functions.c Header_Test.c Pointer_Functions.c -o header_out"

**Run by executing**

"header_out"
